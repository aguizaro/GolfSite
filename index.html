          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            <I>In The Rough</I> is a multiplayer golf party game that was created as a part of the UCSC Senior Capstone Series for Computer Science: Computer Game Design Majors.
            This game was built in Unity 3D levaring Unity Services' Netcode for Gameobjects to create a multiplayer experience. The game is currently in development and is being playtested by the public.
          </p>
          <h3>Constraints</h3>
          <p>Our game was designed under the following externally imposed constraints: </p>
          <div id="constraints">
            <p><strong>Accessibility:</strong> We designed our game to be playable with a single hand by providing an alternate single hand control scheme. We also designed this game in a way that the player reaches a natural resting point within 2 minutes of gameplay.</p>
            <p><strong>Localization:</strong> Our game supports multiple languages including right to left text. We currently support English, Spanish, and Farsi. We have leveraged Unity's localization kit to provide localization and RTLTMPro for right-to-left text.</p>
            <p><strong>Game Format:</strong> Our game was designed to be playable by any internet connected device that has a browser. We recommend using the Google Chrome web browser to play our webGL build.</p>
          </div>
          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>Here are some of the prototypes we made along the way... </p>
          <div class="video-prototype">
            <video controls width="480" height="270">
              <source src="vid/Sprint1_VideoMontage.mp4" type="video/mp4">
              Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
            <p> This is a video montage of our first multiplayer prototype and how we set it up using Netcode for Gameobjects, Unity Relay, and Unity Lobby. This prototype contains the steps our Network and Deployment lead, Tony Guizar, took in order to deliver a seamless muliplayer experience that works globablly and is playable on any modern browser.</p>

              Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
            <p> In this video, Tony explains how our continuous integration / delivery setup works. We used the documentation provided by <a href="https://game.ci/">Game CI</a> in order to test, build and deploy our Unity game every time we push updates to our github repository. This setup allows us to always have the latest build of our game available for playtests or for sharing with others</p>

          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
            <div id="gameplay">
              <p><em>In the Rough</em> is a multiplayer golf party game where players will be able to join a lobby with their friends and play a series of rounds in which they need to make the ball into the hole. This game allows player to player combat by striking your golf club at players. The goal of the game is to make your ball into the hole with the least amount of strokes on your card. This game emphasizes the player to player interaction and competition between players.</p>
              <p>The current vertical slice contains the multiplayer functionality, player combat, a full golf course level, and a single hole to start off. Our vertical slice mostly only contains the main gameplay loop of, swinging your ball at the hole, fighting your opponents, and moving towards the next hole. Our high level goals for expanding this into a full game includes: adding multiple levels / different courses, adding some very simple mini-games around the map that draw the playerâ€™s attention, polishing our main gameplay mechanics, and improving the game feel. It would be great to try and add golf cart driving to the full game, but we are still looking into that feature. </p>
              <p>It is important for the game design seen in our vertical slice to be scaled up to something where players can have a great online experience playing with their friends. The most exciting part of this is being able to navigate to a webpage and start up a game where your friends can easily play with you. We want the players to have fun competing against each other and keep playing together over and over again. For this reason, we need the full game to include attractive and good feeling levels/ courses along with more refined player interactions that keep the player engaged and wanting to tell their friends about this game.</p>
