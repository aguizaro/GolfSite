          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            <i>Golf Bash: Online</i> is a multiplayer golf party game that was
            created as a part of the UCSC Senior Capstone Series for Computer
            Science: Computer Game Design Majors. This game was built in Unity
            3D levaring Unity Services' Netcode for Gameobjects to create a
            multiplayer experience. The game is currently in development and is
            being playtested by the public.
          </p>
          <h3>What is GBO ?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Rather than strictly focusing on core golf mechanics akin to other golf simulation games, our goal is to promote player to player interaction through actions that are not tied down to realism.
            </li>
            <li>
              The goal is to use the “golfing” aspect of the game as a base layer and quickly divert the user’s focus into their own player agency. </li>
            <li>
              Surrealist ragdoll physics and player free-will creates a chaotic party environment that immerses players in fast paced, lawless play.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3> Why are we making GBO?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We believe some of the most rewarding gameplay moments are ones shared between friends.
            </li>
            <li>
              We decided to make a party game that brings out these moments in ways you may not traditionally expect.
            </li>
            <li>
              Players are drawn to games that create unique and comedic experiences within their group of friends, Golf Bash Online aims to do just that.
            </li>
          </ul>

            </div>

          <h3>Constraints</h3>
          <p>
            Our game was designed under the following externally imposed
            constraints:
          </p>
          <div id="constraints">
            <p>
              <strong>Accessibility:</strong> We designed our game to be
              playable with a single hand by allowing remapping of controls and
              a simple control scheme. A color blind mode is coming soon.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Localization:</strong> Our game supports multiple
              languages, including English, Spanish, Farsi, and Chinese. We have
              leveraged Unity's localization kit to provide localization for
              logographic text and right-to-left text.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Game Format:</strong> Our game was designed to be playable
              on Windows and MacOS devices. It is a global multiplayer game that
              allows users to create and join public lobbies to play with
              friends.
            </p>

          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>Here are some of the prototypes we made along the way...</p>
          <div class="video-prototype">

            </video>
            <p>
              This is a video montage of our first multiplayer prototype and how
              we set it up using Netcode for Gameobjects, Unity Relay, and Unity
              Lobby. This prototype contains the steps our Network and
              Deployment lead, Tony Guizar, took in order to deliver a seamless
              muliplayer experience that works globablly and is playable on any
              modern browser.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="video-prototype">

              Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
            <p>
              In this video, Tony explains how our continuous integration /
              delivery setup works. We used the documentation provided by
              <a href="https://game.ci/">Game CI</a> in order to test, build and
              deploy our Unity game every time we push updates to our github
              repository. This setup allows us to always have the latest build
              of our game available for playtests or for sharing with others
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <div id="gameplay">
            <p>
              <em>Golf Bash: Online</em> is a multiplayer golf party game where
              players will be able to join a lobby with their friends and play a
              series of rounds in which they need to make the ball into the
              hole. This game allows player to player combat by striking your
              golf club at players. The goal of the game is to make your ball
              into the hole with the least amount of strokes on your card. This
              game emphasizes the player to player interaction and competition
              between players.
            </p>
            <p>
              The current game version contains the multiplayer functionality,
              player combat, a full golf course level, and 9 golf holes. Our game mostly only contains the main
              gameplay loop of, swinging your ball at the hole, fighting your
              opponents, and moving towards the next hole. Our high level goals
              for expanding this into a full game includes: adding multiple
              levels / different courses, adding some very simple mini-games
              around the map that draw the player’s attention, polishing our
              main gameplay mechanics, and improving the game feel.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is important for the game design seen in our game to
              be scaled up to something where players can have a great online
              experience playing with their friends. The most exciting part of
              this is being able to navigate to a seamless interface and start up a game
              where your friends can easily play with you. We want the players
              to have fun competing against each other and keep playing together
              over and over again. For this reason, we need the full game to
              include attractive and good feeling levels/ courses along with
              more refined player interactions that keep the player engaged and
              wanting to tell their friends about this game.
